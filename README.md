# Vector Sorting Algorithms
![Sorting Algorithms](https://github.com/orzaez/Vector-sorting-algorithms/blob/master/sorting-algorithm-banner.png)

This repository contains implementations of various sorting algorithms optimized for vector data structures in C++. It demonstrates the performance and efficiency of different sorting techniques on vector containers.

## Features

- Implementations of multiple sorting algorithms:
  - Quick Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
- Performance comparison on different data sets.
- Easy-to-understand code with comments.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, etc.)
- CMake (optional for building)

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/orzaez/Vector-sorting-algorithms.git
cd Vector-sorting-algorithms
``` 
### Building the Project

If you are using CMake, follow these steps to build the project:

``` bash

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
``` 
### Running the Examples

After building the project, you can run the compiled executables to see the sorting algorithms in action:

```bash

./sort_algorithm_name
```
Replace sort_algorithm_name with the specific algorithm you want to run.
